        <h3>The Origins:</h3>
        <p>Undertale is an RPG game that was created by the indie developer Toby Fox. The game was set to be released mid-2014 
            however the game was officially released i September 2015 for Windows and OS X. It gained huge notoriety in the 
            media ad quickly became a staple game among the video game population.<br><br>
            The player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of 
            the Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during their journey back to the surface. 
            Some monsters may engage the player in fights. The combat system involves the player navigating through 
            mini-bullet attacks by the opponent. They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead 
            of killing them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.
        </p>
        <h3>The Souls:</h3>
        <p>In the game, a human Soul and monster Soul together can cross the Barrier, while seven human Souls shatter it entirely.
           A Soul takes on the form of a heart. Human Souls point down in most cases, and monster Souls point up.<br><br>
           Human Souls come in several colors and are stronger than monsters' Souls. For this reason, human Souls persist after death.
        </p>
        <h3>The Humans</h3>
        <p>The Eight Humans are the humans from the Surface who fell through the Barrier on Mount Ebott into the Underground. 
            Among them are the first human, the protagonist, and the six other human Souls that Asgore has collected.</p>
